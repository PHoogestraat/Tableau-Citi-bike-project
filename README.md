### Process and Data
An analysis on Citi Bike was completed on Data collected from 2013 to 2021. This data included: Trip Duration (seconds), Start Time and Date, Stop Time and Date, Start Station Name, End Station Name, Station ID, Station Lat/Long, Bike ID, User Type (Customer = 24-hour pass or 3-day pass user; Subscriber = Annual Member), Gender and Year of Birth. From this information a collection of visuals was created to better understand activities at Citi Bike.

### Number of Rides
The number of users declined precipitously from 2013 to 2021. 2014 (the first full calendar year) had approximately 5.4 million trips. By 2020 (last full calendar) 0.337 million daily trips. The peak year of trips taken was 2015 (9.9 million trips). The decline from high to low is 97%. A significant transition is observed between 2016 (9 million) and 2017 (0.275 million trips) regarding the number of trips taken.

### Customer metrics
The majority of customers were born in the 1980’s. However, this data reflecting age is more than likely inaccurate. A large proportion of ages collected were from 1880 to 1930 which is suspect. Approximately 70% of riders are male over the time period observed. Over the same time period 10% of riders did not declare a gender. After a closer inspection of the data, these same consumers also did not submit an age. The safest assumption is that the majority of riders are male. Riders designated as Subscribers make up over 80% of the users over the life of the project.

### Hours of operation and bike ID
Bassed on the annual data, prime rental hour falls between 7:00 AM and 8:00 PM. This was consistent an a monthly, seasonal, and annual basis. The gender ratio of 70% is also consistent during operational hours. A noticeable decline in bike id was also observed between 2016 and 2017. This is consistent with the drop in usage previously mentioned.

### Station activity.
A significant change in stations was observed between 2016 and 2017 which is consistent with the previous data. Most stations listed as active in 2016 were located in the southern portion of Manhattan.  Transitioning to 2017 almost all active stations were in zip code 07302 and the previous stations in Manhattan were not listed.

### Conclusion
Exiting Manhattan had a clear impact on trips taken for Citi Bike. This was observed in radical decreases in trips taken, users, and bike id’s. However, the gender ratio, Customer subscriber ratios, and hours of operation remained consistent.
